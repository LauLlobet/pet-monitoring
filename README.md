# pet-monitoring

Pet project to learn monitoring tools such as: grafana, prometheus , ELK

## Idea:
The idea behind this project is to architecture a project, where it can be monitored. Moreover, I will aim to create this project by steps, using ADR's to keep design decisions&tooling. Stack that I'm willing to learn and apply : Prometheus, Docker, Docker-compose, Micrometer, SpringBoot. I will create a basic API, just to feed monitoring data.
